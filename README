Flaskito is a simple Python web application that was built using Flask Microframework and structured to run with Jython 2.7.1b2 on any Java web container thru the Modjy WSGI adapter.
This was built as an example to demonstrate and showcase that Flask can be "templated" and "WAR'd" without the usage of Pylons or Django (or django-jython or snakefight). 

To build the WAR file:

    $ ./bin/pack

To deploy the WAR file (not upgraded):

    $ ./bin/deploy
    
WARNING: There is a good chance you need to adjust the deploy and undeploy scripts to fit your environment.  This has been confirmed to work in Tomcat 7.0.57.
