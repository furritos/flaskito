Flaskito is a simple Python web application that was built using Flask Microframework and structured to run by Jython on any Java web container thru the Modjy WSGI adapter. I build it just as example to show people how to do it because googling, you will just see samples using Pylons or Django. Just for it, nothing any more.

To run it:

    $ ./bin/pack
    $ ./bin/deploy
    
WARNING: There is a good chance you need to adjust the deploy and undeploy scripts to fit your environment, because I wrote them fitting to my Jetty WebServer.

And finally, it doesn't do anything important.  :p
